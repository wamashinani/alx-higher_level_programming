0.Write a program that imports the function def add(a, b): from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3

You have to use print function with string format to display integers
You have to assign:
the value 1 to a variable called a
the value 2 to a variable called b
and use those two variables as arguments when calling the functions add and print
a and b must be defined in 2 different lines: a = 1 and another b = 2
1.Write a program that imports functions from the file calculator_1.py, does some Maths, and prints the result.

Do not use the function print (with string format to display integers) more than 4 times
2.Write a program that prints the number of and the list of its arguments.

The output should be:
Number of argument(s) followed by argument (if number is one) or arguments (otherwise), followed by
: (or . if no arguments were passed) followed by
a new line, followed by (if at least one argument),
2.Write a program that prints the result of the addition of all arguments

The output should be the result of the addition of all arguments, followed by a new line
You can cast arguments into integers by using int() (you can assume that all arguments can be casted into integers)
3.Write a program that prints all the names defined by the compiled module hidden_4.pyc (please download it locally).

You should print one name per line, in alpha order
You should print only names that do not start with __
Your code should not be executed when imported
4.Write a program that imports the variable a from the file variable_load_5.py and prints its value.

You are not allowed to use * for importing or __import__
Your code should not be executed when imported
